# Salary Prediction using machine Learning

# Project Overview
 This project is a Machine Learning application that predicts the salary of an employee based on their years of experience. It uses a Linear Regression model to learn the relationship between experience and salary, and provides a simple Flask-based web interface for predictions.

 The Project demonstrates the complete workflow of a professional ML project:
 - Data collection and preprocessing
 - Model Training and evaluation
 - Model deployment with a web application
 - Project documentation for GitHub

# Features
- Predicts employee salary based on years of experience
- Uses Linear Regression (scikit-learn)
- Interactive Flask web app for real-time predictions.

# Dataset
- The dataset used is Salary_Data.csv which contains:
  - Years of Experience -> Number of years of experience
  - Salary -> Annual salary of the employee

# Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, Joblib, Flask
- Frontend: HTML, CSS(Flask Templates)
- Verson control: Git + Github
